# Drupal CMS Cdespaces sandbox
This repository is a GitHub Codespaces sandbox for Drupal CMS V1.

When running in GitHub Codespaces, you can open this project in the Codespaces environment and automatically get a functional Drupal setup without having to install local dependencies or manage separate environments.

This setup is intended for quick exploration and is not optimized for rigorous security or performance scenarios.

## Getting started with GitHub

To run this repository on GitHub Codespaces, simply select this repository and create a new Codespace.

Once the environment is ready, you will have a complete Drupal environment running in your browser. You can then open and edit files directly in the browser or connect via VSCode if you prefer.

## Getting starred with Devcontainer

If you wish to run this repository via Devcontainer, make sure your host operating system has both VSCode and Docker Desktop installed.

Then open VSCode, install the Remote-Containers extension, and choose “Open Folder in Container...” from the Command Palette. Select this repository, and you will be connected to a containerized environment for Drupal development. This approach ensures a consistent setup across different machines.
