# Drupal CMS Codespaces sandbox

This repository is a GitHub Codespaces sandbox for [Drupal CMS 1.0](https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-cms-1-0).

When you run this repository in GitHub Codespaces, it automatically sets up a fully functional Drupal environment, so you don‚Äôt need to install local dependencies or manage separate environments. üöÄ

This setup is designed for quick exploration and isn‚Äôt optimized for high-level security or performance scenarios.
